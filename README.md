# go-winrtapi

WinRT (desktop) API bindings for Golang. 

Most of the code in this repo is generated using the [go-winapi-gen](https://github.com/zzl/go-winapi-gen) tool.

I'm not experienced with windows runtime programming, the API bindings 
are not necessarily correct. Use this library at your own risk.
